# VUI_DataViz

Voice based inputs are ​not​ particularly ​intuitive​ but are an ​important​ way of ​communication for all humans. This is why I’ve made an application that uses voice commands to interact with a data visualisation. I’ve tried to keep in mind the [AI Guidelines](http://http://saleemaamershi.com/papers/amershi.HAI.Guidelines.CHI.2019.pdf) while designing this system to better the interaction of AI with Humans. Follow the onscreen instructions to use this application at http://ketakisrao.github.io/VUI_DataViz.

Here is a short video on how this app can be used: https://youtu.be/iT_po_cHJyM


#### Note:
Use the latest version of Chrome or Mozilla Firefox since WebSpeech API is only supported by those
